# CarSheet OCR

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Master's thesis project for the [AI Master's degree](https://idal.uv.es/master_ia3/) at the University of Valencia.

## Features
- Web-based OCR application for Spanish car sheet processing
- Frontend built with Vite.
- Backend powered by FastAPI.
- Custom fine-tuned OCR model based on EasyOCR's architecture
- 30%+ improvement in precision for car sheet text recognition compared to the base model

## Technical Stack
